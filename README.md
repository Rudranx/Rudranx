- ⚡ Fun fact: I write cute poetries for cuties; here's one for you : 
                There was a programmer staring at the screen,
                All code contributed to his scream.
                Disappointed with his skills,
                He decided to climb the coding hills.
                He climbed and climbed until he reached the top:
                "I will be the one, my only hope."
